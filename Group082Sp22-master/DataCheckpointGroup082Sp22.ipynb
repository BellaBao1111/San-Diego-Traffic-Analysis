Once we decide all of them, we could begin cleaning the data by getting rid of all null/na values. There are only a few missing values, and since our datasets contain a lot of observations, we believe that removing few missing values would not impact the overall distribution of the dataset. We should also get rid of all noisy values such as a negative number for inside injured/died columns, but since the data we obtained are from a government website, we believed that we shouldn’t find any invalid value. Our data should not contain any “outlier” since all data are from real traffic collisions and accidents."
